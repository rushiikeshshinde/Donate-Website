 <h4>These Terms and Conditions apply separately to each single donation that you make. Except in Monthly Donations and unless specified by you, they do not form a contract allowing for future or successive transactions to be set up.</h4> By confirming on Iris that you wish to make a donation you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions for that donation.
<p>(1) The donation services. </br>
We will use your donation at our discretion but within our stated charitable objectives.
All payments through the Website are to be made by payment card.
Once you confirm to us through the Website that you wish to proceed with your donation your transaction will be processed through our payment services provider. By confirming that you wish to proceed with your donation you authorize Iris to request funds from your credit or debit card provider.</p>
<p>(2) Unauthorised card use. </br>
If you become aware of fraudulent use of your card, or if it is lost or stolen, you must notify your card provider.</p>
<p>(3) Information from you.</br>
Before we can process a donation you should provide us with details of the credit or debit card that you wish to use to fund the donation. We will use this information to process your donation. It is your responsibility to ensure you have provided us with the correct information.
When you submit your payment details, these details will be transferred to our payment provider, and your payment data will be collected and processed securely by them. You should make sure that you are aware of these terms and conditions, to ensure that you are comfortable with how we will process your personal data before you make a donation.
We won't share your personal details with any other third party other than is set out in our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy forms part of these Donation Payment Terms and Conditions and by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions you are also agreeing to the way we use and protect your personal information in line with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(4) Refund policy. </br>
If you make an error in your donation please contact us either by email at <a href=mailto:Iris@charity.org>iris@charity.org</a>, by phone at <a href=tel:+1-613-555-0128>+1-613-555-0128</a>
or by post at 320, Front St, Toronto, Canada and within 14 days and a full refund will be made to you.</p>
<p>(5) Monthly donations. </br>
These Donation Payment Terms and Conditions will only apply to successive donations made through the Website where you have set up a monthly donation. When you set up a regular donation you will be scheduling a series of donations to be made on the day of the month that you choose until further notice. You agree that these Terms and Conditions will apply to each of the donations in that series.
By confirming that you wish to proceed with a monthly donation you authorize our payment service to request funds from your credit or debit card on the day of each month that you set.
To cancel your regular donation please contact us at at <a href=mailto:Iris@charity.org>iris@charity.org</a>.</p>
